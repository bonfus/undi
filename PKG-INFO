UNDI
----

mUon Nuclear Dipolar Interaction (UNDI) is a small python library to
compute the time dependence of the spin polarization of a muon 
interacting with a number of neighboring nuclei in a solid.

The presence of electric field gradients on the nuclei of the hosting
material and externally applied fields can be easily introduced.

The code is documented at https://undi.readthedocs.io and in the 
`associated pubblication <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2020.107719>`_.
